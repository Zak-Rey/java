acces modifiers are used to set the accesibility of classes, interfaces variables, methods
constructors, data members, and the setter methods.
public methods inside a class can be accessed by other classes while private can't.
They are also known as visibility modifiers. 
you can't set the acces modifiers for getters methods.
Apart from public and private acces modifiers we have default and protected modifiers whose declarations are visible only within the package and
within the package or all subclasses respectively.

DEFAULT ACCESS MODIFIER EXAMPLE:

 package defaultPackage;
class Logger {
    void message(){
        System.out.println("This is a message");
    }
} 

PROTECTED ACCESS MODIFIER EXAMPLE:
  class Animal {
    // protected method
    protected void display() {
        System.out.println("I am an animal");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // create an object of Dog class
        Dog dog = new Dog();
         // access protected method
        dog.display();
    }
}

We cannot declare classes or interfaces protected in java.
