**JavaScript Assignment Operators**

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

Operator | Name | Example
`=` | Assignment operator | `a = 7;`
`+=` | Addition assignment | `a += 5;`
`-=` | Subtraction assignment | `a -= 2;`
`*=` | Multiplication assignment | `a *= 3;`
`/=` | Division Assignment | `a /= 2;`
`%=` | Remainder Assignment | `a %= 2;`
`**=` | Exponentiation Assignment	`a **= 2;` 

**Javascript Arithmetic Operators**

They are used to perform arithmetic calculations

Operator|	Name|	Example
`+`	|Addition|`x + y`
`-`	|Subtraction|`x - y`
`*`	|Multiplication|`x * y`
`/`	|Division|`x / y`
`%`	|Remainder|`x % y`
`++`|Increment (increments by 1)|`++x or x++`
`--`|Decrement (decrements by 1)|`--x or x--`
`**`|Exponentiation (Power)|`x ** y`

**Javascript Arithmetic Operators**

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean value.

Operator | Description | Example

== | Eqaul to: returns true if the operands are equal | x == y
!= | Not Equal to: returns true if the operands are not equal | x != y
`===` | Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type | x === y
!== | *Strict not equal*: true if the operands are not equal at all or equal but of different tpes | x !== y
`>` | *Greater than*: true if the left operand is greater than the right operand | x > y
`<` | *Less than* : true if the right operand is less that the right operand | x < y
`>=` | *Greater than or equal to*: true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand | x >= y
`<=` | *Less than or equal to*: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand | x <= y

**JavaScript Logical Operators**
Logical operators perform logical operations and return a boolean value.
